Project Title: Robust Single-Image Super-Resolution Via CNN’s And TV-TV Minimization

Description:

This project focuses on implementing a robust single-image super-resolution technique using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and TV-TV minimization. Single-image super-resolution is the process of increasing the resolution of an image, obtaining a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) one. By leveraging large training datasets, CNNs currently achieve state-of-the-art performance in this task. However, during testing/deployment, they fail to enforce consistency between the HR and LR images. To address this issue, we propose post-processing the CNN outputs with an optimization problem called TV-TV minimization, which enforces consistency.
